## Update Summary
This is a substantial update compared to version 0.1.2. The workflow was
smoothed considerably and performance was increased. Several new functions can
aid in additional tasks commonly performed when working with LexisNexis data.
Except for lnt_checkFiles(), which was deprecated, old code should still be
compatible. The new version also includes a vignette and tests.
