\description{
Give proper names to LN txt files based on search term and period retrieved
from each file cover page. This information is not always delivered by
LexisNexis though. If the information is not present in the file, new file
names will be empty.
}
\details{
Can check the consistency of LexisNexis txt files. lnt_read needs at
  least Beginning, End and length in each article to work
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# rename files in folder "C:/Test/LNTools test/" and report back if successful
