Description: My PhD supervisor once told me that everyone doing newspaper
 analysis starts by writing code to read in files from the LexisNexis newspaper
 archive. However, while this is a nice exercise I do recommend, not everyone
 has the time. This package takes TXT files downloaded from LexisNexis in
 English and German. If you want other languages included, ask me or fork this
 project! Since this package takes in txt files which are unstructured in the
 sense that beginning and end of an article are not clearly indicated, the main
 function read_LN relies on certain keywords that signal to R where an article
 begins, ends and where meta-data is stored. \code{check_LNfiles} thus tests if
 all keywords are in place. Every article in every TXT file should start with "X
 of X DOCUMENTS" and end with "LANGUAGE:". The end of the meta-data is usually
 indicated by "LENGTH:". Some measures were taken to eliminate problems but
 where these keywords appear inside an article or headline, test1 or test2 from
 the \code{check_LNfiles} will fail and read_LN will not be able to do its job.
 In these cases, it is recommended to slightly alter the TXT files, e.g. by
 changing a headline to "language: never stop learning new ones" instead of
 "LANGUAGE: never stop learning new ones"---as "language:" without capital
 letters is not picked up by the functions.
