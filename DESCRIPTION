Description: My PhD supervisor once told me that everyone doing newspaper analysis
    starts by writing code to read in files from the LexisNexis newspaper archive. However,
    while this is a nice excercise I do recommend, not everyone has the time. This package takes
    TXT files downloaded from LexisNexis in English and German. 
    If you want other languages included, ask me or fork this project :).
