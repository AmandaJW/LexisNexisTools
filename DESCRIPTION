Description: My PhD supervisor once told me that everyone doing newspaper analysis
    starts by writing code to read in files from the LexisNexis newspaper archive. However,
    while this is a nice excercise I do recommend, not everyone has the time. This package takes
    TXT files downloaded from LexisNexis in English and German. 
    If you want other languages included, ask me or fork this project :).
	Since this packages takes in txt files which are unstructured in the sense that beginning and end of an article is not clearly indicated, the main function read_LN relies on certain keywords that signal to R where an article begins, ends and where meta-data is stored. check_LNfiles thus tests if all keywords are in place. Every article in every TXT file should start with "X of X DOCUMENTS" and end with "LANGUAGE:". The end of the meta-data is indicated by "LENGTH:". Some measures were taken to eliminate problems but where these keywords appear inside an article or headline, test1 or test2 from the check_LNfiles will fail and read_LN will not be able to do its job. In these cases it is recommended to slighly alter the TXT files, e.g. by changing a headline to "language: never stop learning new ones" instead of "LANGUAGE: never stop learning new ones".
