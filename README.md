# LexisNexisTools
My PhD supervisor once told me that everyone doing newspaper analysis
    starts by writing code to read in files from the LexisNexis newspaper archive. However,
    while I do recommend this excercise , not everyone has the time. This package takes
    TXT files downloaded from LexisNexis (tested in English and German). 
    If you want other languages included, ask me or fork this project :).
